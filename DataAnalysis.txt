Dashboard 1:
The two maps on this dashboard display the start stations and end stations in the city along with their coordinates and the name 
of the station. 
The exisiting start and end stations are mostly the same. There is only one ending station that is not also a starting station. 
Because the clustering shows that there are more station on the East side of the map, it would seem that there are more riders in that
area than in the other parts.


Dashboard 2: 
The two graphs display the duration of trips between the first half of the month versus the second half of the month of March 2020. 
The first half being from the 1st to the 15th and the second half from the 16th to the 31st. 
Looking at the two lines, there does not seem to be a clear correlation between the trip duration and time of the month, as there are
high and low points in both halves. 


City Official Map:
The comparison of popular start and end stations shows that the cluster of stations on the East side of the map has a heavier use by 
riders.
